/// A transitive order is defined as the transitive combination of multiple
/// orders into a single equivalent order. For example consider the following
/// two orders:
/// - *A*: buying 1.0 token 1 selling 2.0 token 2
/// - *B*: buying 4.0 token 2 selling 1.0 token 3
///
/// We can define a transitive order *C* buying 1.0 token 1 selling 0.5 token 3
/// by combining *A* and *B*. Note that the sell amount of token 3 is limited by
/// the token 2 capacity for this transitive order.
///
/// Additionally, a transitive order over a single order is equal to that order.
