Execute the django-test as follows;

Restart the event listener to reflect the change in environment variables.

```bash
docker-compose restart listener
```


Initiating Events from the Smart Contract
-----------------------------------------

From within the [dex-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/dex-contracts) repository, with the truffle console
run the following command to give the smart contract a basic setup( registing accounts and tokens)

```
truffle exec scripts/setup_environment.js 
```

Then you can use the account 1 to deposit 1 amount of token 1
```
truffle exec scripts/deposit.js 1 1 1

```
