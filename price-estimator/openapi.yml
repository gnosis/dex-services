    get:
      summary: Estimated Amounts At Price
      description: Estimate largest buy and sell amounts for a limit at given price that would get matched. Note that it might be possible to use a higher buy amount for the same returned sell amount and still likely get completely matched by the solver. This buy amount can be computed with a subsequent estimate buy amount API call using the returned sell amount in quote value.

      description: Estimates the exchange rate for the market. Note that the true exchange rate depends on the buy amount whereas this exchange rate is for a theoretical 0 amount. In the example we can exchange ~300 units of the sell token for 1 unit of the buy token.
